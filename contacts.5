.TH CONTACTS 5 LIBCONTACTS
.SH NAME
contacts \- Simple and flexible contact information file format

.SH DESCRIPTION
The directory
.I ~/.config/contacts
is used to store files with contact information, one
person per file, in the format specified by this document.
File names that end with a tilde
.RB ( ~ )
are reserved for temporary storage while saving a file
so that an already existing file (with the same name minus
the tilde) is replaced before the new version is completed,
and also so that other processes do not read incomplete files.
File names that start with a dot
.RB ( . )
are reserved for special purpose entries.
It is recommended that file names do not contain any other
characters than lower case ASCII letters, ASCII digits and
ASCII hyphen
.RB ( - ).
Subdirectories are prohibited.
.PP
The recommended default format for a file name is the
name as the user prefers it to be displayed in the latin
alphabet, in lower case with all non-letters (e.g. hyphens)
removed, and spaces replaced with hyphens.
.PP
The currently defined special puporse entries are:
.TP
.B .me
The user himself.
.TP
.B .nobody
Unused data, such as created groups without any members.
.PP
The files in
.I ~/.config/contacts
are UTF-8 text files, meaning that they must not contain
any NUL bytes and each line is terminated by a <newline>
.RB ( \(aq\en\(aq ).
.PP
Each line in the file is a data entry and should begin
with combination of printable ASCII characters, mostly
upper case letters, called a tag, (non-standard entires
should also begin with
.BR X- ),
followed by either a colon
.RB ( : ),
or a regular blank space (horizontal tab should also be
tolerated) followed by the data for the entry. Some lines
however are only flags and only contain the tag. Lines
using the colon alternative must end with that colon,
and subsequent lines starting a horizontal tab (one or more
regular blank spaces and horizontal tabs should also be
tolerated), until but excluding the subsequent first line
that does not start this way, shall be considered subentries
(this indentation is excluded in the description above, but
is there for subentries, top-level entries are not
indented). There is no prescribed order for entries.
